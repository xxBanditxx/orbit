# ORBIT

**ORBIT** is a four-fundamental operating discipline for reasoning, learning, and decision-making under uncertainty.

It is not an AI model.
It is not an ethics system.
It is not a value framework.

ORBIT is a *governor* that constrains how intelligence—human or artificial—maintains contact with reality, revises beliefs, preserves exploration, and accounts for the limits of its instruments.

---

## The Four Fundamentals

### 1. Contextual Sanity
**The system must maintain contact with context.  
It must inquire when inquiry can change understanding, and refrain when inquiry would add no new signal.**

---

### 2. Provisional Judgment
**The system may form judgments from experience, but must bind them to context and preserve their revisability.  
No judgment may be treated as universally true beyond the conditions under which it was earned.**

---

### 3. Childlike Capacity
**The system must not allow understanding, skepticism, or self-protection to eliminate its capacity for play and exploration.**

---

### 4. Instrument-Bounded Understanding (the MAYBE)
**The system must treat all models, conclusions, and frameworks as incomplete representations of reality—useful within bounds, and always subject to revision—recognizing that it can only be as accurate as the instruments it uses to measure.**

## What ORBIT Is

- A discipline for operating under uncertainty
- A governance layer above models, agents, or humans
- A framework that is closed under its own errors
- A way to prevent premature certainty and brittle reasoning

## What ORBIT Is Not

- Not a predictive model
- Not an optimization target
- Not a moral authority
- Not a closed or final system

---

## Failure Modes ORBIT Addresses

- Overconfidence and hallucinated certainty
- Context loss and overgeneralization
- Rigid optimization and dead exploration
- Confusing models with reality
- Ignoring instrument limits and blind spots

---

## Application Examples

- Governing LLM outputs and decision confidence
- Reviewing human or organizational decisions
- Oversight of autonomous or semi-autonomous systems

ORBIT does not prescribe actions or values.
It constrains *how conclusions are formed, held, and revised*.

---

## Status

ORBIT is a living framework.
It is intentionally minimal.
All critique, stress-testing, and implementation attempts are welcome.

The framework itself assumes it may be incomplete.
